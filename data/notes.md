## Examples of patterns

"1103 generations to stabilize
by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping gliders (The glider is a pattern that travels across the board)"

## Undecidability:

"...Many patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination."
